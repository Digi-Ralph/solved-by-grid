# Solved *by* Grid

Solved *by* Grid is a personal collection of common HTML templates solved by the built-in [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/) feature.

CSS Grid allows to build complex layouts very simply and it is easy to learn.

# Contribute

Clone this repository and run `yarn install` ([`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)  must be installed on your system) then run `yarn start` which runs a local webserver using `browser-sync`. Make sure your web browser supports CSS Grids.

Create additional layouts in folders like `my-new-template` and link to it from the root  `index.html`.
